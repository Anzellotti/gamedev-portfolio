#  **Finished Games**

># Onigiri

- Top-down physics-based action game
- First gamedev experience
- Developed on Unity
- **Winner of the Cotoletta d'Oro (first place) at [Cotoletta 8-bit](https://www.cotoletta8bit.it/)**

This game was developed for the Videogame Design and Programming course at Polimi from October 2023 to January 2024. It was developed by a team of five students, and I took on the role of team leader, lead designer and programmer.\
The goal of the course was to develop a vertical slice of a game with a duration of 20 minutes.\
The game received the maximum grade of 30L from the course. We got a third place at Unimi's NGD 2024, and a first place at the first edition of Cotoletta 8-bit.

># Untitled plane game

- Online pvp plane combat
- Networked Physics simulation
- Developed on Unreal Engine 5

The development of this game started as a way to learn Unreal Engine, as well as a way to improve in some areas I felt I was lacking in, namely 3D and online. The development took about a month, between September and October 2024.\
The game utilizes the new Networked Physics system, which allows for a seamless experience when controlling the physics-driven plane while maintaining the authority of the centralized dedicated server.


># Tower of Ashes

- Turn-based roguelike
- Expansive upgrade system
- Developed on RMXP (Ruby)
- **Winner of the jury's vote at [EE Jam 10](https://eeveeexpo.com/game-jam-10/overview/)**

This game was developed for the EeveeExpo Summer Game Jam, in just over a month across July and August 2024, in a team of two people.\
I personally implemented the various complex systems needed to provide a roguelike experience, such as the procedural generation of the levels and the in-battle upgrades system.\
This development experience was particularly interesting as I was not familiar with Ruby before the jam, so it proved a nice challenge.\
The game won the jury's vote, as one of the jam's two best games.

># Build-a-Bearration

- Top-down bullet heaven
- Customizable player character
- Developed on Unity

I developed this game for the Acerola Game Jam 0, a two-week game jam with a maximum team size of 1.\
It features a flexible character builder that allows for a lot of wonky combinations, and an upgrade system to power up as the game goes on.

#  **Gamedev-adjacent projects**

># AR application for medical training

- Master thesis project at Polimi
- Positive feedback by a group of thoracoscopy surgeons
- Developed on Unity 6

Currently still in development, this project is my master thesis project, developed under Professor Marco Gribaudo, with the assistance of PhD student Marco Domenico Buttiglione.
The application uses the XR Interaction Toolkit to provide a physics-based simulation of two surgical operations (thoracoscopy and laparoscopy) in an AR environment. In particular, a large focus of the development is to offer a platform-agnostic set of tools to be used in further development by future theses.

[This section will be updated in the future with some footage and the final evaluation.]
># Dungeon Mesh

- Very basic game engine
- Entity-component-system architecture
- Built-in scene editor
- Written in C++, using Vulkan for rendering and GLFW to handle window and input

This project was developed over a couple of weeks for the Computer Graphics course at Politecnico di Milano, in a group with two other students. We received the maximum grade of 30L.\
I personally handled the engine side of the project, from the loading of the scene from disk to the entity-component-system architecture, as well as some lower-level aspects with some Vulkan calls to correctly render the billboards, and some shader logic.
