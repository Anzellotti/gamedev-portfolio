  <li><strong>Winner of the Cotoletta d’Oro (first place) at <a href="https://www.cotoletta8bit.it/">Cotoletta 8-bit</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This game was developed for the Videogame Design and Programming course at Polimi from October 2023 to January 2024. It was developed by a team of five students, and I took on the role of team leader, lead designer and programmer.<br />
The goal of the course was to develop a vertical slice of a game with a duration of 20 minutes.<br />
The game received the maximum grade of 30L from the course. We got a third place at Unimi’s NGD 2024, and a first place at the first edition of Cotoletta 8-bit.</p>

  <li><strong>Winner of the jury’s vote at <a href="https://eeveeexpo.com/game-jam-10/overview/">EE Jam 10</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This game was developed for the EeveeExpo Summer Game Jam, in about a month across July and August 2024, in a team of two people.<br />
I personally implemented the various complex systems needed to provide a roguelike experience, such as the procedural generation of the levels and the in-battle upgrades system.<br />
This development experience was particularly interesting as I was not familiar with Ruby before the jam, so it proved to be a nice learning opportunity.<br />
The game won the jury’s vote, as one of the jam’s two best games.</p>

<p>I developed this game for the Acerola Game Jam 0, a two-week game jam with a maximum team size of 1, in March 2024.<br />
The game features a flexible character builder that allows for a lot of wonky combinations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online pvp plane combat</li>
  <li>Networked Physics simulation</li>
  <li>Developed on Unreal Engine 5</li>
</ul>

<p>The development of this game started as a way to learn Unreal Engine, as well as a way to improve in some areas I felt I was lacking in, namely 3D and online. The development started in September 2024, but is currently on hiatus as I focus on my master thesis.<br />
The game utilizes the new Networked Physics system, which allows for a seamless experience when controlling the physics-driven plane while maintaining the authority of the centralized dedicated server.</p>

  <li>Turn-based combat</li>
  <li>Flexible buff/debuff system</li>
  <li>Minimax enemy AI</li>
  <li>Entire battle logic written in C#</li>
</ul>

<p>A prototype for a turn-based battle system I’d like to expand on in the future. It was written in a couple of weeks in June 2024.<br />
The most interesting aspect of this project is the fact that all of the battle logic is written in pure C#, with all Unity-specific logic such as monobehaviours decoupled by using observers and callbacks. This allowed me to easily implement a very flexible enemy AI that utilizes minimax tree search to select optimal moves.</p>

  <li>Very basic game engine</li>
  <li>Entity-component-system architecture</li>
  <li>Built-in scene editor</li>
  <li>Written in C++, using Vulkan for rendering and GLFW to handle window and input</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was developed over a couple of weeks for the Computer Graphics course at Politecnico di Milano, in a group with two other students.<br />
I personally handled the engine side of the project, from the loading of the scene from disk to the entity-component-system architecture, as well as some lower-level aspects with some Vulkan calls to correctly render the scene, and some shader logic.<br />
We received the maximum grade of 30L.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Master thesis project at Polimi</li>
  <li>Simulator for complex surgical operations</li>
  <li>Developed on Unity 6, for the Meta Quest 3S headset</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently still in development, this project is my master thesis project, developed under Professor Marco Gribaudo, with the assistance of PhD student Marco Domenico Buttiglione.<br />
The application uses the XR Interaction Toolkit package to provide a physics-based simulation of two surgical operations (thoracoscopy and laparoscopy) in an AR environment, in order to aid the training of future surgeons.<br />
A large focus of the development is to offer a platform-agnostic set of tools to be used in further development by future theses.<br />
While the research part is still ongoing, the application received positive feedback by a group of thoracoscopy surgeons.</p>

<p>[This section will be updated in the future with some footage and the final evaluation.]</p>
